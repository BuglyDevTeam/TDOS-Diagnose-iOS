/// Preserves backtraces across asynchronous calls.

/// On OS X, you can enable the automatic capturing of asynchronous backtraces
/// (in Debug builds) by setting the `DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES` environment variable
/// to `@executable_path/../Frameworks/ReactiveCocoa.framework/ReactiveCocoa` in
/// your scheme's Run action settings.
///
/// On iOS, your project and RAC will automatically use the `rac_` GCD functions
/// (declared above) for asynchronous work. Unfortunately, unlike OS X, it's
/// impossible to capture backtraces inside NSOperationQueue or other code
/// outside of your project.
///
/// Once backtraces are being captured, you can `po [RFKTBacktrace backtrace]` in
/// the debugger to print them out at any time.
